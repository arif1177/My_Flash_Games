To play - 
1. You need to have adobe flash player. Otherwise, install from adobeâ€™s official site.
2. Double click on the swf file to run it (you may need to give permission to run flash player)
3. If clicking does not run the file, just go to http://flashplayer.fullstacks.net/ and upload the .swf file. Set size as 800 by 800px (like before, may need to permit web browser to run flash content).


Personal notes: I made it long before (2010) using adobe flash and actionscript 3.0. It was advanced programming course and I did not even require to make it graphical. However, I felt that it would be nice to make it in forms of an actual game and as well as a good learning experince. The heuristic algorithms (below the game canvas) were also implemented in actionscipt.
Anyway, enjoy the game! It would give some trouble running it. But should be fine if you follow the above instruction.
