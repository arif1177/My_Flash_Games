# My flash-based games
Back in 2000, I was a fan of Flash-based animations and learnt Actionscript. Made few projects for both fun and academic purposes during 2006-2010. There were two particular projects that I still have the codes for after the old HDD crashed. So there they are - 

1. **Missionaries_and_Cannibals**: This was originally a coding exercise during Articifial Intelligence couse which I happily turned into an interactive game out of fun and curiosity. The puzzle is a classic toy-problem in computer science and comes in different variations ([wiki link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missionaries_and_cannibals_problem)).

   A detailed information and how to run the game is given inside the folder.
